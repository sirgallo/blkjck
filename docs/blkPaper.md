SirGallo - 2024


## overview

`blkjck` a decentralized, autonomous blackjack protocol that looks to be a fair platform, built utilizing the high throughput `Solana` blockchain to settle transactions for games between players. 

Players register themselves onto the platform and have the option to either enter the game lobby or the liquidity pool dashboard. The liquidity pool is linked to the Solana program and acts as collateral for wins and losses on the platform. Tables are program derived accounts that players register onto. Every choice made by a player during a round is encoded into a transaction. Losses are paid into the liquidity pool and wins are paid out of the liquidity pool. Players that provide liquidity earn passive revenue on the interest incurred from the losses in the pool. A small fraction of each transaction will also be a developer fee that goes to the platform. Tables do not have dealers and instead are dealed automatically by the smart contract, which keeps track of the current deck, round, and wagers that players have made. The platform looks to incentivize players to return by providing kickbacks from the collateralized pool backing the platform.
